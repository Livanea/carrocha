            <h5>The Scarfs |<i> Os Lenços</i></h5>
            <h6>Branding & Packaging design | Illustration</h6>
            <p>Done for a college project,  for my Graphic & Multimedia Design B.A. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The briefing revolved around creating a new version of traditional Portuguese games.</p>
            <br>
            <br class="broff">
            <br class="broff">
            <p>For this project, I chose three traditional games that I used to play as a kid, and that have in common their main material, a piece of fabric, usually "lenços," or scarves.</p>
            <p>Illustrations printed on the scarf using silk-screen printing.</p>            <br>
            <br>
            <br class="broff">
            <br class="broff">
            <p>The first game is <i>"O lençinho,"</i> The Little Scarf. There are several players in a circle and a player with the scarf walking around the circle, while everyone sings the game song. The player with the scarf has to drop it behind another player. Once this player notices that the scarf was dropped behind them, they have to catch the one who dropped the scarf before they take this player’s place in the circle</p>
            <br>
            <br class="broff">
            <p>The second game is <i>"Cabra-Cega,"</i> The Blind Goat, hence the illustration on this scarf. The player who is the "blind goat" is blindfolded with the scarf, and has to touch one of the other players, who will then be the "blind goat."</p>
            <br>
            <br class="broff">
            <p>The third game is <i>"Barra,"</i> The Bar, there are two teams with multiple players, and a judge, who holds the scarf. The judge calls numbers corresponding to a player of each team, the first player to grab the scarf wins a point for their team. The judge can also call for fire and water, both have different rules restricting the actions of the teams. Since, the judge calls for numbers, fire, and water, these are illustrated in this scarf.</p>
